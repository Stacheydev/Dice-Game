# Dice-Game

Project Description:  
This is a simple two-player dice game. Each player takes turns rolling a dice. If the roll results in a 1 or 6, the player's turn ends immediately, and their score for that turn resets to 0. The goal is to strategically "redeem" your points and add them to your total score before rolling a 1 or 6. The counter in the middle will show the sum of your dice rolls so far. The first player to reach a total score of 50 wins the game.

Getting Started:  
Click the GitHub Pages link in the project description, found at the top right of the repository view.  
Alternatively, you can pull the code from the repository and open the index.html file using your favorite web browser.  

How to Use:  
Player 1 starts by pressing the roll button at the bottom left to roll the dice, if the player rolls a one or a six, the turn will end and move to the second player. If the roll is any other number, the counter in the middle will be updated accordingly and the player can choose to redeem their points and add them to their total score using the button located at the bottom right. The first player to reach a total score of 50 wins!
